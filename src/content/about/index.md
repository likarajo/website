Hi! I'm Rajarshi, a software engineer based in Fremont, CA. 
I enjoy keeping myself up-to-date with the latest technologies through internet, books, or discussions, 
and try to build something useful with it. 
I am passionate about giving back to the community, and take interest in utilizing big data and applied machine learning 
to gain valuable insights relevant to our world.

When I am not in front of the computer or in study-mode, I am probably hanging out with friends and watching or playing soccer, 
traveling, hiking, or exploring cuisines.

I am pursuing graduate education at [University of Texas at Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/), 
and am currently interning in the IT infrastructure team at [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) where I work on multiple 
automation projects on a daily basis.

Here are a few technologies, programming languages, and frameworks I have worked with recently on professional as well as personal projects:
