- Learned embedded and software solution designing and programming using Finite State Machines (FSM), Assembly Language Programming (ALP), Verilog Hardware Description Language (VHDL).
- Designed and developed a 16-bit Reduced Instruction Set Computing processor with Harvard Architecture using Verilog Hardware Description Language as part of senior year thesis. 
The processor has been implemented with a minimal area on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) kit and tested using Assembly Language Programming (ALP). 
Presented demo at the national seminar on Advanced Microprocessor and VLSI Devices at college. First Runner-up in Technical Paper Contest organized by Institute of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineers.
- Designed and developed a bootable IntelÂ® MCS51 Board as part of my junior year thesis that can be used to program the microcontroller directly from the 
hyper terminal without having to write and burn the monitor program on a separate ROM. I am the owner of the intellectual property of the prototype.
